The search for engineered signals uses some of the same tools as astronomers use to search for pulsars. Here you can find some general information on pulsar search software from Scott Ransom and Ryan Lynch, as well as a tutorial for the tools on some of the calibrator data we obtain of pulsars with Breakthrough Listen at the GBT.
